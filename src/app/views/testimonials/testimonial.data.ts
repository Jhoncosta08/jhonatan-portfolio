    testimonial: `I've been working with Jhonatan for a few months now, and I'm glad to have him on the team.
  He is always one step ahead when it comes to participating and translating the client's needs
  to fitable and doable development solutions. He is always ready to help and is extremely proactive,
  organized, communicative and seeking for quality, which is so important to the business, to the team's
  atmosphere and to get things done more effectively and in a timely manner! And I'm pretty sure that if Jhonatan
  keeps this hands-on posture up and openness to learn, he'll color even more this beautiful journey he's been writing.`

He is communicative, always calm, and willing to execute tasks. He likes to share the information he learns. I have always told him that he has the gift for teaching, he just needs to invest in it. Keep it up, Jho, always studying and dedicating yourself to what you do. Success!'
